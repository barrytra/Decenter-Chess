# Decenter Chess

### demo video

## Idea
The idea is to create a decentralised chess game platfrom where users can play chess with their friends by staking cryptocurrencies. all the data of every game is stored in blockchain.

## What it Does
A decentralised multiplayer Chess game platform. It has two modes to play:
1. Unrated Mode: It is a friendly mode where you can play without staking any tokens. 
2. Rated Mode: Here users can stake tokens Users connect via metamask account. As you connect we get two options create game or join game. One user creates the game by entering a game ID of his choice. The other user on his server joins the game by entering the same game ID entered by his friends. Once they join and sign the contract, game starts. At the end of the game winner gets a metamask popup to sign his winning contract.
